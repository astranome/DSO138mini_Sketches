# DSO138mini_Sketches
 JYETech DSO138mini(https://jyetech.com/dso138mini-oscilloscope-diy-kit/) is Oscilloscope DIY Kit.
 
 There is **STM32F103C8T6** and TFT LCD(320x240) on this board. So we can use Arduino for STM32.
 
 - I suggest to develop using **PlatformIO**.

# Install Arduino bootloader to DSO138mini
 If you want to write a sketch only with a USB cable, you would install **STM32duino bootloader**.(It means Maple mini DFU bootloader).
